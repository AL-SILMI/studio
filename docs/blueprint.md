## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Very light grayish-blue (#F0F8FF). It evokes a sense of calmness, clarity, and trustworthiness. This off-white background is easy on the eyes during extended use.
- Primary color: Muted light blue (#77B5FE). It provides a gentle, non-intrusive visual cue that maintains a focus on content. The choice of hue is close to the background, creating a cohesive feel, and this keeps attention on the content instead of the chrome.
- Accent color: Light sea green (#20B2AA). A brighter alternative to the primary hue, without being too distracting.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for a balance of modernity and warmth.
- Use simple, clear icons that are easily understandable, representing different cognitive tasks and data points.
- Maintain a clean and uncluttered layout to minimize distractions and cognitive overload. Use white space effectively to improve readability.
- Incorporate subtle animations to provide feedback on user interactions and guide them through the assessment process without being disruptive.
